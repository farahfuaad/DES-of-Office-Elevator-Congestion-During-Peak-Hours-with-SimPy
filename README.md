# Discrete Event Simulation (DES) of Office Elevator Congestion During Peak Hours with SimPy

## Objectives
1.	To develop an Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) model that represents elevator usage and congestion in an office building during peak hours.
2.	To analyze and identify factors that contribute to elevator congestion during peak period such as morning arrival, lunch break and end of workday.
3.	To explore and test different elevator control strategies like optimized scheduling algorithms and grouping user by floor range to reduce congestion.
